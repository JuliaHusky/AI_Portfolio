# AI_Portfolio
This repository contains four Jupyter notebooks showcasing applied artificial intelligence projects developed in Python using real-world datasets. The work includes multiple data modalities tabular (task 1), image (task 2), audio (task 3), and text data (task 4) and compares classical machine learning models with deep learning models. 

## Project Overview

The portfolio consists of the following AI tasks:

### 1. Tabular Data – Income Prediction
- Dataset: Adult Income (UCI Repository)
- Task: Binary classification
- Techniques: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, Neural Networks
- Evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC
- Explainability: Feature importance and SHAP analysis

### 2. Image Data – Crop Disease Classification
- Dataset: PlantVillage
- Task: Multi-class classification
- Techniques: Classical ML with feature extraction, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- Evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
- Explainability: Grad-CAM visualisations

### 3. Audio Data – Urban Sound Classification
- Dataset: UrbanSound8K
- Task: Multi-class classification
