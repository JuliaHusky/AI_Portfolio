# AI_Portfolio
This repository contains four Jupyter notebooks showcasing applied artificial intelligence projects developed in Python using real-world datasets. The work includes multiple data modalities tabular (task 1), image (task 2), audio (task 3), and text data (task 4) and compares classical machine learning models with deep learning models.
